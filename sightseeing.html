    <h4>Money</h4>
    <p>
      Sweden is not part of the Euro zone and uses its own currency, the Krona (Crown), abbreviated <em>SEK</em>, <em>SKR</em> or just <em>kr</em>. One Krona is equivalent to roughly 11.5 yen or 14 cent.

    <h4>Taxes</h4>
    <p>
      Sweden has very high taxes, with a general consumption tax at 25%. For certain items, like groceries and books it can be lower, at 12% and 6%. Alcohol and tobacco is generally expensive becuase of even higher consumption tax on them. So if you plan on making big purchases, make sure you get a tax-free receipt.

    <h3>Getting around</h3>

    <h4>SL</h4>
    <p>
      Stockholm has excellent public transport with buses, subway, trains and trams. They are all provided by the state, use the same payment system and tickets are valid on all forms of transport. You purchase tickets in advance, either a one-trip ticket, multiple journey ticket or a multi-day pass. Your ticket is valid for any transport up to an hour after the time stamped on the ticket by the ticket attendant. Cash is not accepted on buses, trains or trams so make sure that you purchase your ticket beforehand.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find the best route you go to <a href="http://www.sl.se/">sl.se</a> and use the search system. <strong>T-Centralen</strong> is the main subway and train hub in the middle of Stockholm. <strong>Östra Station</strong> is the train stop connecting <strong>Åkersberga</strong> with Stockholm by the <strong>Roslagsbanan</strong> local train. The adjacent subway stop is <strong>Tekniska Högskolan</strong>. <strong>Gamla Stan</strong> is the subway stop for the Old Town, and <strong>Medborgarplatsen</strong> will take you to hip Södermalm.
    </p>

    <h4>Bikes</h4>
    <p>
      Next to walking this is by far the most beautiful way to see Stockholm. The city is bike friendly and many people do their commute on a bike. There is a network of bikes for hire in the inner city.
    </p>

    <h4>Taxi</h4>
    <p>
      Taxis are generally expensive in Stockholm, but as long as you travel in central Stockholm you should be able to keep under 200 SKR. There are far fewer cabs in Stockholm compared to cities like Tokyo or New York. Look for black and or yellow cars. Most cabs accept credit card.

    <h3>Water</h3>
    <p>
      Stockholm is known as the Venedig of the north since it’s situated on an archipelago with a rich boating culture. Taking a boat trip from the inner city harbor <em>Skeppskajen</em> to old cities further out in the Archipelago is a great way to spend an hour. Waxholm is one such city, and if you want to see how Sweden looked a hundred years ago this is the place to go. A beautiful, small wodden city with a large stone castle just outside the harbor.

    <h3>Food</h3>

    <h4>Swedish Food</h4>
    <p>
      Sweden might be best known for rubbery IKEA meatballs but we have a lot more to offer. Fish and seafood is a big part of cousine along the coast. You will be able to have excellent codfish and shrimp in addition to smoked salmon and <em>gravad</em> salmon (gravlochs). Late August is also the start of crayfish season and Swedish people throw big crayfish parties and drink nearly as much <em>brännvin</em> as at midsummer’s. Swedes are also fond of pickled herring, <em>sill</em>. There is also a fermented variety called <em>surströmming</em> that is said to be on of the stinkiest foods on the planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meat, potatoes and onions are the staples of Swedish household cooking, <em>husmanskost</em>. Some dishes to take note of is meatballs, <em>köttbullar</em> and the mix of diced meat, sausages, onion and potatoes known as <em>pytt i panna</em>. <em>Wallenbergare</em>, patties made from heavy cream and minced calf meat, traditionally served with lingonberries and green peas. On the weirder side of the spectrum we have <em>blodpudding</em>, blood pudding. It is nothing like English blood sausage, and has a lean texture and mild, slightly sweet taste. It’s commonly eaten as a quick meal, pan fried served with sour cream, lingonberries and red onion. You will also be able to enjoy a great variety of root vegetables like black root, red beets and <em>palsternacka</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When hung over you cure it best with either a local sloppy pizza or kebab. Swedes also take their hot dogs, <em>korv</em>, very seriously and you can find boiled and grilled in stalls all over the country. There is also the large <em>Falu</em> sausage, a common and quick meal.
    </p>

    <h4>Restaurants</h4>
    <p>
      There are a ton of good restaurants in Stockholm. We have listed some of our favorites in this Foodspotting <a href="http://">guide to Stockholm’s best food</a>.

    <h3>Norrö</h3>
    <p>
      Kim’s home in Sweden. His family and grandmother have two adjacent houses on a lush peninsula next to horses and a large forest. It’s beautiful but located far from everything else. The closes bus stop and grocery store is a 20 minute walk away. To compensate for this you can walk straight into the forest and pick lingonberries, blueberries and mushrooms or take a dip in the lake surrounding the area.
    </p>
    <p>
      The closest town, <strong>Åkersberga</strong>, is a typical Swedish suburb, built mainly in the 60s but with a just-completed new shopping center. It’s not much to look at, but it is the local train and bus hub.

    <h3>Language</h3>

    <h4>Bork bork bork</h4>
    <p>
      No, we don’t actually have a word like that. Swedish is related to German and English but with a distinct “singing” sound. There are three letters in addition to the normal English 26: Åå, Ää and Öö.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Swedish people speak very good English and you will have no trouble navigating the city by English alone.

    <h3>People</h3>
    <p>
      Swedes are generally friendly and do not bite. However, they can seem distant and cold and first and it is common not to talk to strangers you sit next to on public transport. But do not hesitate to ask for directions.
